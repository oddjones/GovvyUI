Liverpool.gov.uk "Govvy" UI
===========================

This is a template for third parties who wish to style their applications to match Liverpool.gov.uk's current look and feel.

Liverpool.gov.uk makes use of icon font rendering and as such these templates need to be run from a web server in order to render correctly. 

The templates have been constructed expecting the site to run as a virtual host with its own uri.

A sample site can be seen at [http://http://oddjones.github.io/GovvyUI/]
